Subject: The Critical Role of Deep Learning and Optimization in Biostatistics: A Case Study in COVID-19 X-Ray Classification

It's clear that Deep Learning is rapidly transforming biostatistics, particularly in the field of medical image analysis. I am currently exploring this intersection by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify COVID-19 X-ray images, leveraging the power of the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

Building a model is one thing; building a robust and generalizable model is the real challenge.

My initial architecture utilized key Keras layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense. To enhance performance and stability, I integrated crucial hyperparameter optimization techniques:

BatchNormalization: To accelerate training and stabilize the learning process.

Dropout: To introduce regularization and prevent the model from "memorizing" the training data.

The initial training results (attached) perfectly illustrate a classic data science challenge. The charts show that while the model quickly achieved near-perfect accuracy on the training set, the validation (test) accuracy plateaued.

More revealingly, the validation loss and MSE (Mean Squared Error) began to increase after the 4th epoch, while the training loss plummeted. This is a definitive sign of overfitting.

This case highlights a critical point in biostatistics: a model that isn't generalizable is not reliable for clinical use. The true work of a statistician in AI is not just to build, but to rigorously optimize and validate. My next steps will focus on more advanced data augmentation and further tuning of the model's architecture to bridge this gap between training and validation performance.
